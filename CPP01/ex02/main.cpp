/* Why donâ€™t we use *ptr to get the memory address?
Good observation. The key is:

Expression	Meaning
ptr	The address stored in the pointer
*ptr	The value at that address
&ptr	The address of the pointer itself

In your code:
cpp
Copy
Edit
std::string* ptr = &str;
std::cout << ptr;     // shows the address ptr holds: same as &str
std::cout << *ptr;    // dereferences: shows value at that address ("HI...")
You use ptr (no *) when you want to print the memory address the pointer holds.
You use *ptr when you want to access the actual value at that address.





Think of:

ptr as the mailbox number (address)

*ptr as the letter inside (value)

If you want to go to the house, use the address: ptr
If you want to read the letter, open it: *ptr*/
